# Markdown Basics

#### In this tutorial I will be going over the basics to learn how to use markdown and having it open on Github!

# Markdown Basic Syntax:

When you are using markdown there are certain sticky keys that help you get your point across. Such as *this is italicized right?* and **this is bolded right?**

There is many different syntax for what you are looking for such as #size of text#, *italicized*, and **bolded text**!

### Here are some examples of syntax to use to get what you want:

1. Headings
Using # you can change the size of text you want! Starting with Heading 1 which is the biggest and Heading 6 being the smallest. The more hashtags or pound keys you add the smaller it will be and the less amount the bigger it will be. Here is an example of each of the headings!

# Heading 1 
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
#### Heading 4
##### Heading 5
###### Heading 6
