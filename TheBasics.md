# Markdown Basics

#### In this tutorial I will be going over the basics to learn how to use markdown and having it open on Github!

# Markdown Basic Syntax:

When you are using markdown there are certain sticky keys that help you get your point across. Such as *this is italicized right?* and **this is bolded right?**

There is many different syntax for what you are looking for such as size of text, *italicized*, and **bolded text**!



### Here are some examples of syntax to use to get what you want:

1. Headings

-Using # you can change the size of text you want! Starting with Heading 1 which is the biggest and Heading 6 being the smallest. The more hashtags or pound keys you add the smaller it will be and the less amount the bigger it will be. Here is an example of each of the headings!

# Heading 1 
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
#### Heading 4
##### Heading 5
###### Heading 6




2. Italic

-Italizing text is my favorite markrdown basic syntax, and it also is probably the easiest. To italiczed text all you have to do is put a * or an astrick in front and behind the word or sentence such as this *Hi there!* but you can't see the astricks so this is what is looks like * Hi there! * but without the spaces. You can out anything your heart desires in italic just as long as you add astricks.

*Like I could copy the entire paragraph up there and show you that I can quite literally italize anything my heart desires but I'll be nice and just do this sentence :)*


3. Bold

-Bolding text could also be very useful when using markdown to bold important infomation such as dates, times, peoples names, or even the entire thing. To bold soemthing you will add ** 2 astricks in front and behind the word or sentence such as this **Hi there!** but you can't see the astricks once again so this is what it looks like ** Hi there! ** but without the spaces. 

**Like I could copy the entire paragraph up there and show you that I can quite literally bold anything my heart desires but I'll be nice and just do this sentence :)**
