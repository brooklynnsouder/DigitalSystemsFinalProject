# DigitalSystemsFinalProject
**Digital Concepts Tutorial**

This is my final for my class Digital Systems.

This was created by Brooklynn Souder.

The purpose of this final project is to make a markdown that is hosted in Github to show the processes of using systems, digital concepts, and using markdown.

The target audience for this tutorial is anyone who wants to learn more about markdown, the basics of coding, and/or learning how to use Github.
