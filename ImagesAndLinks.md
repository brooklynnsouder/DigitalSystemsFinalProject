# Complex Markdown Syntax

Compared to the basics I just taught you there is more complex thing you can do with markdown. Such as adding images, hyperlinks, highlighting, mark through, tables, etc.

## Here are examples what to use to get what you want 

1. Images

Images are fairly easy to put in markdown. All you have to do is type ! [ your text ] ( image.jpg )" due to this being an example nothing will show but I will be including some images from my Spotify Wrapped this year! :) Images will be at the bottom of this page


2. Hyperlinks
Adding links or articles to your markdown page is very helpful for viewers or readers to know what you are talking about. To add links all you have to type is [title](https://example.com)
