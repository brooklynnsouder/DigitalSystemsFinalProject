# Complex Markdown Syntax

Compared to the basics I just taught you there is more complex thing you can do with markdown. Such as adding images, hyperlinks, highlighting, mark through, tables, etc.

## Here are examples what to use to get what you want 

1. Images

Images are fairly easy to put in markdown. All you have to do is type ! [your text](image.jpg ) due to this being an example nothing will show but I will be including some images from my Spotify Wrapped this year! :)
