# Complex Markdown Syntax

Compared to the basics I just taught you there is more complex thing you can do with markdown. Such as adding images, hyperlinks, highlighting, mark through, tables, etc.

## Here are examples what to use to get what you want 

1. Images

Images are fairly easy to put in markdown. All you have to do is type ! [ your text ] ( image.jpg ) but without the spaces. Due to this being an example nothing will show but I will be including some images from my Spotify Wrapped this year! :) Images will be at the bottom of this page


2. Hyperlinks
Adding links or articles to your markdown page is very helpful for viewers or readers to know what you are talking about. To add links all you have to type is [ title ] ( https://example.com ), again also without the spaces, but here is an actual example of hyperlinks [Example Hyperlink](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)


3. Highlighting
Highlighting is also a fun way to draw the viewers eyes to a certain part of the page. To highlight you have to type == 2 times on the first and last words for it to highlight. Here is an example ==these words are so important I gotta highlight==
