# Complex Markdown Syntax

Compared to the basics I just taught you there is more complex thing you can do with markdown. Such as adding images, hyperlinks, highlighting, mark through, tables, etc.

## Here are examples what to use to get what you want 

1. Images

Images are fairly easy to put in markdown. All you have to do is type ! [ your text ] ( image.jpg ) but without the spaces. Due to this being an example nothing will show but I will be including some images from my Spotify Wrapped this year! :) Images will be at the bottom of this page


2. Hyperlinks

Adding links or articles to your markdown page is very helpful for viewers or readers to know what you are talking about. To add links all you have to type is [ title ] ( https://example.com ), again also without the spaces, but here is an actual example of hyperlinks [Example Hyperlink](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)


3. Strikethrough

Strikethrough is also a fun way to draw the viewers eyes to a certain part of the page. To strikethrough you have to type ~~ 2 times on the first and last words for it to strikethrough. Here is an example ~~these words are so important I gotta strikethrough~~


4. Emoji

Using emojis are helpful for the viewer to understand how you are saying something. To use emojis you'll have to know what each emoji is called or copy and pasting them, this article is very helpful [Emojis](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/#copying-and-pasting-emoji). To use emojis you have to add : colons before and after the words. Here is an example I hope you are laughing so hard rightnow because I am using this emoji :joy: or I :heart: you!


5. Footnotes

Using footnotes allow the reader to do research without leaving and looking it up. To make a footnote you have add [^1] at the end of the sentence. Here is an example: This is a sentence with a footnote [^1]

[^1] : This is the footnote
